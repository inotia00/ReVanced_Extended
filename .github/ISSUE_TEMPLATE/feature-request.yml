        # ReVanced Extended feature request

        Before creating a new feature request, please keep the following in mind:

        - **Do not submit a duplicate feature request**: You can review existing feature requests [here](https://github.com/inotia00/ReVanced_Extended/labels/Feature%20request).
        - **Do not write feature requests targeting YouTube**: Due to too many feature requests targeting YouTube, DEV is no longer accepting them.
